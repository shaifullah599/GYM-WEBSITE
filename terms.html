    </p>


<p>GYM Freakz is a collection of NFTs (Non Fungible Tokens/digital artworks) running on the Ethereum blockchain. This website is only an interface <br>
     allowing participants to exchange digital collectibles. Users are responsible for the safety and management of their own Ethereum wallet and <br>
      validating all transactions and contracts related and generated by GYM Freakz before approval. By using GYM Freakz you are accepting sole <br> responsibility for any and all transactions involving GYM Freakz digital artworks.

<h3>OWNERSHIP</h3>

<p>i. The user that is buying and minting our GYM Freakz artwork is the owner of the Non Fungible Token (NFT) crated by validating the transaction. Each GYM Freakz is an NFT on the Ethereum blockchain. When you purchase an NFT, you own all the rights to the underlying GYM Freakz. Ownership of the NFT is mediated entirely and only by the Smart Contract and the Ethereum Network which means that, at no point, may we seize, freeze, or otherwise modify the ownership of any GYM Freakz. ii. Personal Use. Subject to your continued compliance with these Terms, GYM Freakz grants you a worldwide, royalty-free license to use, copy, and display the purchased GYM Freakz(s), along with any extensions that you choose to create or use, solely for the following purposes: (i) for your own personal, non-commercial use; (ii) as part of a marketplace that permits the purchase and sale of your GYM Freakz/NFT, provided that the marketplace cryptographically verifies each GYM Freakz owner’s rights to display the GYM Freakz and ensures that only the actual owner can display the GYM Freakz; or (iii) as part of a third party website or application that permits the inclusion, involvement, or participation of your GYM Freakz, provided that the website/application cryptographically verifies each GYM Freakz owner’s rights to display the GYM Freakz and ensures that only the actual owner can display the GYM Freakz, and provided that the GYM Freakz is no longer visible once the owner of the GYM Freakz leaves the website/application. iii. Commercial Use. Subject to your continued compliance with these Terms, fatapeclub.io grants you an unlimited, worldwide license to use, copy, and display the purchased GYM Freakz for the purpose of creating derivative works based upon the GYM Freakz (“Commercial Use”). Examples of such Commercial Use would be the use of the GYM Freakz to produce and sell merchandise products (T-Shirts etc.) displaying copies of the GYM Freakz. For the sake of clarity, nothing in this Section will be deemed to restrict you from (i) owning or operating a marketplace that permits the use and sale of GYM Freakz generally, provided that the marketplace cryptographically verifies each GYM Freakz owner’s rights to display the GYM Freakz and ensures that only the actual owner can display the GYM Freakz; (ii) owning or operating a third party website or application that permits the inclusion, involvement, or participation of GYM Freakzs generally, provided that the third party website or application cryptographically verifies each GYM Freakz owner’s rights to display the GYM Freakz and ensures that only the actual owner can display the GYM Freakz, and provided that the GYM Freakz is no longer visible once the owner of the Purchased GYM Freakz leaves the website/application; or (iii) earning revenue from any of the foregoing.
